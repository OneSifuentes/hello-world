Hi! Just started to learn to code:]
I just started freecodecamp and started getting familiar with html and css
Today I seriously considered attending a boot camp to solidify my commitment. They cost a decent amount of money but I'm sure they work. I quickly learned that established institutions such as Harvard hosts their computer science course online. It's a free resource that I will more than likely attend. I also found out about meta's certification and the associated job board. The job board can only be accessed if you complete their course, however. I find it to be a middle ground. Where instead of learning completely independently from any structure, meta will guide and support me. I enrolled and I set myself a goal of finishing the course within 7 weeks. will advise.
